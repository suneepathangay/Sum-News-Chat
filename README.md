# Sum News Project Overview

Greetings! This repository hosts the Sum News application, a culmination of our efforts to streamline the news consumption process through automated summarization. Developed as a Flask-based application, Sum News represents the intersection of several advanced computational techniques and frameworks, including TensorFlow, Hugging Face, Langchain, and Pinecone. This document outlines the core functionality, technological stack, and guidelines for engagement with the project.

## Project Features

Sum News introduces a series of functionalities aimed at enhancing user engagement with digital news content:

- **Automated Summarization**: Central to the application is its ability to condense multiple news articles into concise summaries of 3-4 sentences, enabling users to quickly grasp the essence of the content without the need for extensive reading.

- **Vector Embedding via TensorFlow**: Leveraging TensorFlow's embedding capabilities, the application translates user-input text into vector representations, facilitating nuanced text analysis and processing.

- **Similarity Analysis**: The project employs a custom-developed algorithm that utilizes a similarity matrix to assess and rank sentences based on their relevance and importance, ensuring that summaries are both comprehensive and focused.

- **Interactive Chatbot**: Incorporating Langchain and Hugchat technologies, Sum News features an interactive chatbot, allowing users to pose questions and seek clarifications on summarized content, thus enriching the user experience.

## Technological Stack

The Sum News application is built upon a robust stack of technologies, chosen for their performance, scalability, and relevance to the project's objectives:

- **Python**
- **Flask**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Hugging Face**
- **Langchain**
- **Pinecone**
